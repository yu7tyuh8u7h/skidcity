# bleed
> An open-source replication of the Discord bot "bleed"

## Notice
- This project is currently a work in progress and should not be utilized at this time.
- Once development is completed, I plan to provide a comprehensive guide on setting it up.

## Why?
The motivation behind initiating this project stems from my personal experience with the owner of bleed (**jon**), who consistently harassed me due to my possession of a bot capable of performing similar functions as bleed.

The situation escalated to the extent where he resorted to making threats, including the endangerment of my entire family, simply because I had created a replica of his Discord bot. 

I do not recommend purchasing bleed, as doing so would only contribute to the egotistical tendencies of its creator, who lacks any notable qualities apart from boasting about the wealth accumulated through bleed.

## Credits
This replica is made by **@rxwastaken**
